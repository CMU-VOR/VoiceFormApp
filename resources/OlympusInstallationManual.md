Go to the folder that you want the Olympus package to be located, for example the /Documents folder, right click at any blank place and select **SVN Checkout**, the GUI of TortoiseSVN will appear. Type in the following link, then the Olympus package will be downloaded to the current directory.

	```
	svn co http://trac.speech.cs.cmu.edu/svn/olympus/tags/2.6.1
	```

3. Install the **Win32::RunAsAdmin** and **Win32::Env** module with the following command line.
	
	```
	ppm install Win32::RunAsAdmin
	ppm install Win32::Env
	```
	
4. Open the command line tool **Developer Command Prompt for VS2012** (Developer Command Prompt for VS2015 is not acceptable) and select **Run As Administrator**, then navigate into the Olympus folder. Use the following command to install the Olympus package.
